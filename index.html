  <!--I added meta description and meta content from advice from the practical activity on the Open University,
      However, I was also reading about how meta content no longer affects search results because they do not affect Google
      ranking algorithyms, but they can help 'click through rate' - how often people click on it. Therefore, would
      increase the ranking of the page through increasing clicks. I chose the key words based on the information in 
      the case study videos and what the members and organised described as important aspects of the club -->

      <div><h2>About the running club</h2></div>
      <p>The Club is run on a rather informal basis in that there are no fixed meeting times or formally arranged groups, or club fees! </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Runners usually run at lunchtimes and meet each other by informal arrangement at the pavilion.</p> 
      <p>In general there is a group (mainly men) that leaves for a run at about <b>12.20pm</b> 
      <p>then other groups (mainly women) that leave between <b>12.30pm</b> and <b>12.45pm.</b> </p>
      <p>From time to time there are more organized training sessions to do fartlek or interval training.</p>
      <p>Each month a handicap race is arranged so that runners can compete with one another.</p> 
      <p>These races are either: <i>5 miles</i>, <i>10km</i> or <i>5km.</i></p>
